# **Introduction**

The XYZ Router - TC interface serves as a user interface between the operator and advanced software for a three-axis CNC machine, featuring capabilities such as automatic tool change, support for various types of linear and rotary parking systems, and digital output control during G-code execution via M-Code. Complementary features like the ability to connect an XBOX controller and keyboard as remote controllers, automatic park position adjustment, and the definition of up to 6 reference points for work start positions make machine operation easy and precise for operators. All inputs and outputs are pre-configured by default, so no additional programming is required. The interface can also be customized visually to fit the industrial needs and branding of manufacturing companies.

One of the key advantages of Radonix software and interfaces is the ability to install, set up, and display G-code in 3D while performing various settings such as defining digital inputs and outputs, adjusting speed, acceleration, and other related parameters. These settings can even be tested and simulated in G-code mode without requiring hardware. This feature allows users to gain an initial understanding of Radonix controllersâ€™ performance and functionality, significantly simplifying the setup and configuration process.

**Setting Up Inputs: General Overview**

Configuring inputs in our CNC system is an essential step to ensure smooth operation, precise control, and safety. Inputs can be categorized into two main types based on their configuration and purpose: **Hardware-Based Inputs** and **Software-Based Inputs.** This flexibility allows the system to adapt to a wide range of applications and machine requirements.

---

## **1. Hardware-Based Inputs**

Hardware inputs involve physical devices connected to the controller, enabling direct interaction with the machine's environment. These inputs are crucial for safety, machine control, and real-time feedback.

!https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/26629e82-13c9-4084-96dd-228aca52449f/b6bf2353-d2c8-46e5-b817-7852a26c6ed7/image.png

The digital inputs of Radonix controllers are named as I.[n], where n is a number greater than zero and represents the input number. These inputs are isolated by optical couplers and have low noise tolerance due to their low impedance.

The digital inputs on Radonix controllers have the capability to switch between NPN and PNP modes depending on the output of the device or sensor. The mode changeover switch must be set to PNP position for devices with PNP output and NPN position for devices with NPN output.

In various branches of industrial automation, there are equivalent terms for PNP and NPN. Some
examples of these terms include:
NPN = Sink = Low Active
PNP = Source = High Active

### **Switching Between PNP and NPN Modes in Radonix Systems**

The ability to switch between **PNP** (positive logic) and **NPN** (negative logic) modes in Radonix controllers depends on the specific **board model** being used. This flexibility allows the system to be compatible with different wiring and sensor configurations.

- **PC Pro LAN:**
    - A **small DIP switch** is present on the board.
    - This switch allows users to toggle between **PNP** and **NPN** modes.
    - **How to Use:**
        - Locate the DIP switch on the board.
        - Toggle the switch to the desired mode (PNP or NPN).
        - Ensure the board is powered off before making changes to prevent damage.
            
            !https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/26629e82-13c9-4084-96dd-228aca52449f/5234e53a-523b-434b-be9f-d99db25f2795/image.png
            
- **PC Smart:**
    - Instead of a DIP switch, the **PC Smart** model uses a **Come Pin** for each set of 4 input pins.
    - This pin allows you to define the input logic (PNP or NPN) for the corresponding inputs.
    - **How to Use:**
        - Connect the **Come Pin** to the appropriate voltage (positive for PNP or ground for NPN).
            
            **1.PNP Mode (Source Mode):**
            
            - If the COM pin is connected to **0V**, the input pins will be triggered (turned ON) by a **24V signal**.
                - In this configuration, the sensorâ€™s output wire must provide a 24V signal to activate the input.
            
            **2.NPN Mode (Sink Mode):**
            
            - If the COM pin is connected to **24V**, the input pins will be triggered (turned ON) by a **0V signal**.
                - In this configuration, the sensorâ€™s output wire must pull the input to 0V to activate it.
        - Each group of 4 input pins has its own Come Pin, allowing for mixed configurations within the same board.
        
        !https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/26629e82-13c9-4084-96dd-228aca52449f/ba60d093-16bc-4c0e-aa31-cc53ea55edea/image.png
        

### **Examples of Hardware Inputs:**

- **Home Sensors:** Establish the reference (Home) position for the machine most of them are **Proximity**
- **Emergency Stop Buttons:** Ensure immediate halting of operations in emergencies.
- **Other Proximity Sensors:** Detect objects or tools in the machine's workspace.
- **Push Buttons and Selector Switches:** Trigger specific machine functions or modes.
- **Scanners:** Measure or detect specific properties, often used in specialized processes such as Glass **or gold CNC operations**.

### **Configuration Process**

1. **Connection:** Physically connect the hardware component (e.g., a switch or sensor) to the designated input pin on the controller.
2. **Input Definition:** Use the controller software to define the role of the input (e.g., `HomePin`, `LimitPin`, or a custom input for specific functions).
3. **Polarity Settings:**
    - Set the input type as **Normally Open (NO)** or **Normally Closed (NC)** based on the connected hardware's default state.
    - For example:
        - An NC emergency stop button remains active (closed) until pressed.
        - An NO proximity sensor activates (closes) only when an object is detected.

The digital outputs of Radonix controllers are named O.[n], where n is a numerical identifier greater than zero and represents the output number .

Radonix controllers incorporate robust protection mechanisms for **Outports** to ensure durability, safety, and reliability. These mechanisms vary between different models, specifically the **PC-Pro** and **PC-Smart** boards, each with distinct protection features and failure handling processes.

### **Output Behavior in PC-Pro LAN Models**

- The **PC-Pro LAN** model outputs are fixed in **NPN mode**.
- **How It Works:**
    - When an output is **ON**, it provides **0 volts** by pulling the signal to ground.
    - When an output is **OFF**, it is in a high-impedance state, effectively disconnecting the circuit.
- **Wiring Consideration:**
    - Connected devices must be compatible with NPN logic, where the load receives voltage from a positive source and is activated when the output pulls the circuit to ground.

### **Output Behavior in PC-Smart Models**

- The **PC-Smart** model offers a flexible configuration where outputs can operate in **PNP mode** or **NPN mode**, depending on the connection of the **COM Pin**.
- **How It Works:**
    - The voltage provided by the outputs depends on what is connected to the **COM Pin**:
        - **COM Pin Connected to 24V:** Outputs will provide **24 volts** when activated.
        - **COM Pin Connected to Ground:** Outputs will provide **0 volts** when activated (NPN mode).
- **Flexibility:**
    - This design allows PC-Smart models to adapt to different wiring requirements and device logic preferences.

### **Configuration Process for Outputs:**

1. **Connection:**
    - Physically connect the hardware component (e.g., relay, electric valve , Barke , alarm) to the designated output pin on the controller.
    - Ensure proper wiring based on the required logic (PNP or NPN) and voltage compatibility.
2. **Output Definition:**
    - Use the controller software to define the role of the output (e.g., `SpindleCWpin`, `Coolant`,`SpindelCoverpin` or a custom output for specific functions).
    - Assign the output to its intended device or operation in the system settings.
3. **Logic Settings:**
    - Set the output logic based on the connected device's requirements:
        - **Active High (PNP):** The output sends voltage (e.g., 24V) when activated.
        - **Active Low (NPN):** The output pulls the signal to ground (0V) when activated.
4. **Testing and Validation:**
    - After configuring, test the output to ensure it operates as intended in CAM Pro Test application.
    - Use a multimeter or other diagnostic tools to verify output voltage and behavior.

## **2. Software-Based Outputs**

**Software-Based Outputs** provide simple logical functionality to configure and integrate them with related physical hardware. These features are crucial for enhancing control capabilities. They facilitate quick and simple installation without the need for microprogramming. Users can simply select options from a list and configure settings to maximize efficiency.

As illustrated in the figure, each output is divided into three sub-branches, as detailed below:

1. **Enable**: This sub-branch can be set to two values: True or False.
2. **Link**: Specifies the duty or task that needs to be performed or checked. This includes any device that can serve as an output, such as actuators, lights, and alarms.
3. **NC**: Determines whether the specific output is Normally Open (NO) or Normally Closed (NC).

### **Examples of Software Outputs**

- **Virtual Relays:**
    - Use software parameters to define activation boundaries for devices based on operational needs.
- **Logical Triggers:** Define conditional triggers for activating specific outputs (e.g., alarms or Relay for specific function ).
- **Simulated Outputs:** Employ these for testing or in scenarios where physical components are not available.

### **Configuration Process**

1. **Access the Configuration Interface:**
    - Navigate to the controller's software settings to manage outputs.
2. **Define Parameters:**
    - To configure an output like an order to forward the VFD, enter parameters.
    - setting â€”â†’ System â€”â†’ Outports â€”â†’ Enabled= True
        
        ```
                                                                                   Linked = SpindleCWPin
        
                                                                                   NC= True
        
        ```
        
3. **Validate Settings:**
    - Test the configured software outputs to ensure they function correctly and safely, verifying their effectiveness in real-world applications.
