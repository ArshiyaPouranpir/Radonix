# **Installation and Setup Process for Radonix CNC Controller**

Radonix recommends following this detailed step-by-step guide for installing and configuring a Radonix CNC controller. The process encompasses everything from wiring the hardware to setting parameters in the software. This approach aims to guarantee a seamless installation experience for customers, addressing all critical components.

## **Wiring Components for a Radonix CNC Controller**

Proper wiring is the foundation of a reliable and high-performing CNC machine. A professional approach to wiring ensures seamless communication between the Radonix controller, servo or stepper motors, sensors, VFDs (Variable Frequency Drives), and other peripherals. This guide provides expert advice on wiring all components, including selecting appropriate power supplies, ensuring safety, and achieving optimal performance.

**1. Main Components Overview**

A typical CNC system includes the following components, all of which require precise and secure wiring:

1. **Radonix CNC Controller:** The central control unit.
2. **Servo or Stepper Motors:** Responsible for axis movement.
3. **Variable Frequency Drive (VFD):** Controls the spindle motor.
4. **Sensors:**
    - **Home Sensors** for axis referencing.
    - **Limit Switches** for boundary control.
- **Home Sensors** for axis referencing.
- **Limit Switches** for boundary control.
1. **Emergency Stop (E-Stop):** Ensures immediate shutdown during emergencies.
2. **Power Supplies:** Provides regulated power for different components.
3. **Peripheral Outputs:** Includes relays, coolant pumps, and alarms.

**2. Wiring the Main Power Supply**

**Choosing the suitable Power Supply**

- **Controller Power Supply:**
    
    It is recommended to use 24V switching power supplies to power the Radonix controllers. Calculating Power Supply Current To determine the required power supply current in the electrical panel, the current consumption of each element connected to the power supply must be calculated. For example, if there are 4 relays, 3 pneumatic solenoid valves, and a controller in a switchboard, the current consumption can be determined using Ohm’s law (V=I*R). The electric currents should be calculated and their sum considered as the current of the power supply, along with a confidence factor of a few percent. For example, if the current consumption of the relays is 0.1A and that of the solenoid valves is 0.25A, the total current can be calculated as follows: Total current = controller current + relay current + solenoid valve current IT = 0.5 + 4 * 0.1 + 3 * 0.25 = 1.65A
    

**3. Anti-Noise Measures for CNC Wiring**

Electromagnetic interference (EMI) or electrical noise is a common issue in CNC systems, particularly when wiring sensitive components like controllers, servo drives, and sensors. Noise can disrupt signals, cause erratic machine behavior, and even damage components over time. Implementing robust **anti-noise measures** is critical for ensuring the reliable and precise operation of your CNC machine.

**Sources of Electrical Noise**

1. **High-Frequency Devices:**
    - Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs)-  (In Related Machines)
    - Switching power supplies
2. **High-Power Components:**
    - Spindle motors - (In Related Machines )
    - Servo and stepper motors
3. **Long Cables:**
    - Longer cables act as antennas, picking up EMI.
4. **Proximity to Power Lines:** 
    - Signal and power cables running close together can cause interference.

**Key Anti-Noise Measures**

**1. Use Shielded Cables**

- **Purpose:** Shielded cables reduce the effect of electromagnetic interference on sensitive signals.
- **Implementation:**
    - Use twisted-pair shielded cables for signal lines like **Pulse+, Pulse-, Direction+, Direction-**, and sensor signals.
    - Connect the shield to ground at **one end only** to avoid ground loops.

**2. Separate Signal and Power Cables**

- **Purpose:** Prevent high-power cables from inducing noise in low-power signal cables.
- **Implementation:**
    - Route signal cables (e.g., sensor and control signals) separately from power cables (e.g., motor power and VFD output).
    - Maintain at least 10-15 cm of separation between these cable types.
    - Use different cable trays or conduits for power and signal lines.

**3. Proper Grounding**

- **Purpose:** A well-designed grounding system minimizes noise and protects components.
- **Implementation:**
    - Create a central grounding point in the electrical box, often referred to as a **grounding bus bar**.
    - Ensure all grounding wires (controller, drives, motors, etc.) connect to this central point.
    - Avoid daisy-chaining ground connections, which can introduce noise.

**4. Install Ferrite Beads**

- **Purpose:** Ferrite beads filter out high-frequency noise on signal and power cables.
- **Implementation:**
    - Clip ferrite beads onto signal and control cables near the controller or servo drives.
    - Use multiple beads for particularly noisy environments.

**5. Proper VFD Wiring**

- **Purpose:** VFDs are a significant source of electrical noise and require special attention.
- **Implementation:**
    - Use shielded cables between the VFD and spindle motor.
    - Ground the cable shield at the VFD end.
    - Install line filters or chokes on the VFD input and output to suppress noise.

**6. Shorten Cable Lengths**

- **Purpose:** Longer cables are more susceptible to picking up noise.
- **Implementation:**
    - Keep cable lengths as short as possible without compromising flexibility.
    - Avoid unnecessary slack or loops in the wiring.

**7. Use Isolated Power Supplies**

- **Purpose:** Prevent noise from one system affecting another.
- **Implementation:**
    - Use separate, isolated power supplies for sensitive components like sensors, encoders, and the controller.
    - Ensure power supplies are adequately rated and properly grounded.

**8. Use Optical Isolation**

- **Purpose:** Protect the controller from noise on external connections.
- **Implementation:**
    - Use opto-isolators for connections to external devices like sensors, relays, or switches.
    - Many Radonix controllers have built-in optical isolation for inputs and outputs.

**9. Secure Connections**

- **Purpose:** Loose connections can act as noise sources.
- **Implementation:**
    - Check all connectors for tight and secure connections.
    - Use locking connectors where possible to prevent accidental disconnections.

**10. Line Filters and Surge Protectors**

- **Purpose:** Suppress high-frequency noise and protect against voltage spikes.
- **Implementation:**

## Glass Branch

### Loader Down Delays

This parameter is crucial for managing how glass sheets are deposited back onto a surface or into a new position .The "Loader Down Delay" serves a parallel purpose during the lowering or placement phase.

### Understanding Loader Down Delay

**1. Purpose of Loader Down Delay:**

- **Controlled Descent:** This delay regulates the speed and timing of lowering the glass to ensure that it is placed gently and precisely. It prevents any sudden drops that could crack or shatter the glass.
- **Stabilization:** Allows the machinery and the glass to stabilize before final placement, ensuring that the glass is perfectly aligned according to the operational requirements.

**2. Implementation and Benefits:**

- **Enhanced Safety:** By controlling the descent, loader down delays minimize the risk of damage to both the glass and the machinery, enhancing operational safety.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Slowing down at critical moments allows for finer adjustments in positioning, which is especially important for complex assemblies or delicate glass types.
- **Operational Efficiency:** While introducing a delay might appear to slow the process, it actually enhances efficiency by reducing the likelihood of errors and the subsequent need for rework or glass replacement due to damage.

### Loader Up Delays

### Loader Up Delays in Glass Sheet Handling

The term "Loader Up Delays" refers to the timed intervals that are crucial when using mechanical loaders to handle glass sheets, particularly in settings where CNC machines are employed for cutting or processing. These loaders can be hydraulic (hydric) or pneumatic, and each type has its unique characteristics and operational requirements.

**Hydraulic Loaders:**

- **Functionality**: Hydraulic systems utilize fluids to generate the force needed to lift and move heavy glass sheets. These systems are known for their smooth and powerful operation.
- **Delay Significance**: Delays in hydraulic systems may occur as the fluid pressure builds up to the required level for operation. These delays are crucial for ensuring that the movement starts smoothly and that the glass is handled safely without abrupt movements that could lead to damage.

**Pneumatic Loaders:**

- **Functionality**: Pneumatic loaders use air pressure to operate. They are generally faster than hydraulic systems but might not provide the same level of force.
- **Delay Significance**: In pneumatic systems, delays might be used to control the rapid response time of air pressure build-up, ensuring that the glass sheets are not subjected to sudden jolts, which could cause cracks or breaks.

**Operational Considerations:**

- **Safety**: Delays are programmed to ensure that the load is securely held before movement starts, preventing slippage or misalignment.
- **Efficiency**: Properly timed delays contribute to the operational efficiency of the loading/unloading process, allowing for seamless transitions and minimizing the risk of mechanical failures or glass damage.

**Adaptability Across Models:**

- Different models of loaders, whether hydraulic, pneumatic, or other types, can have varied settings for these delays depending on the machine design, the weight of the glass sheets, and the specific requirements of the operation.

In industrial settings where precision and safety are paramount, understanding and setting these "Loader Up Delays" correctly is essential. They ensure that the machinery operates within safe parameters while maintaining efficiency and protecting the materials being handled. This careful balancing of delay times helps optimize the overall workflow and extends the lifespan of both the mechanical loaders and the glass materials they handle.

In the context of handling glass with loaders that feature intensive movements, having dual parameters for "Loader Up Delays" is particularly important. These parameters are specifically designed to manage and mitigate the risks associated with the rapid and forceful movements of the loader, ensuring both safety and precision during operation.

### Importance of Managing Intensive Movements

**1. Reducing Mechanical Stress:**

- **Rationale:** Intensive movements can generate significant mechanical stress on both the glass and the machinery. By implementing strategic delays, these stresses can be controlled, reducing the potential for mechanical failure or damage to the glass.
- **Implementation:** The first delay might be used to moderate the initial impact when the glass is picked up, while the second delay could be crucial just before the glass is set down at the processing point.

**2. Enhancing Precision and Safety:**

- **Precision:** Delays help in finely tuning the placement of the glass, crucial for processes like cutting or engraving, where exact alignment directly impacts product quality.
- **Safety:** Slowing down the loader movements at critical junctures prevents accidents that could arise from the glass being handled too abruptly, protecting both the operators and the material.

**3. Maintaining Operational Efficiency:**

- **Efficiency:** While it might seem counterintuitive, integrating these delays can actually improve the overall speed of operations by reducing downtime associated with errors or damage.
