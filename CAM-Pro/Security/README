# Introduction

This README provides an overview of the various security features available in the Radonix CAM-Pro software for managing the CNC controller. These features include password protection, time-based locks, and monitoring the controller's operation time.

# Password Protection

To secure the device settings and prevent unauthorized changes by non-experts in the Radonix CAM-Pro software, you can define an 8-character password consisting of numbers, letters, and symbols with case sensitivity. This password restricts the ability to modify specific settings related to the essential variables of the device, and without it, only the general settings can be altered.

# Time-based Locks

Radonix CAM-Pro software allows you to set up time-based locks to control the operation of the device at specific times. The time-based locks can help ensure proper financial settlement for the device and prevent unauthorized use.

# Work Time

In Radonix CAM-Pro, you can monitor the controller's operation time when the connection between the controller and the interface is established. The software displays the operation time in the Security tab of the Settings window. Note that the recorded operation time only includes instances when a program is executed.
